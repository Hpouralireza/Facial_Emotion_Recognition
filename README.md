# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)
This project has been implemented in two methods: 

1. The first method is using a pre-trained model from the deepFace module.
2. The second method involves creating and training a model using the FER-2013 dataset with 7 emotion types, which is available on Kaggle.

#

Both methods have the capability to detect 7 types of emotions, and the mentioned models are as follows:
* Angry
* Disgusted
* Fearful
* Happy
* Sad
* Surprised
* Neutral
  
#

Some results:

With comparing the two trained models using the same input, it can be concluded that the deepFace model has lower accuracy compared to the our trained model with the dataset.
